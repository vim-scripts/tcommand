VIM plugins are cool but with time you forget about even useful 
commands. This plugin provides a command (|:TCommand|) that lets you 
select a command or menu item from a list (you can optionally display 
help on the currently hightlighted command) and then run it from the 
command line. It thus provides an alternative to the built-in 
command-line completion.
